This is the code for my reboot of my web site. 
I realized that my first creation of my web site was not very functial, and did not look good at all. 

This web site will consitst of acouple of parts. 
The html code for the layout of the site. 
The angular code that will control actions on the site. 
The PHP code that will deliver request from angular. 
and lastly time permitting mongo db for blogs and other db needs. 

feel free to suggest fixes or better ways to do something. 
I am in this for the learning experience as well as the completion of my new site.
